Project
Improving Practices for Asking Sensitive Questions in Surveys
52200

Social scientists regularly ask sensitive questions in surveys. This is often necessary to investigate 
research questions of great importance. However, respondents might be uncomfortable answering such questions 
directly. Researchers have therefore developed certain techniques to ask sensitive questions indirectly, 
in a way that is not intrusive. The so called *list experiment* is arguably the most popular among these tools. 
While this method is very promising, it also has several important drawbacks. In particular, the technique works 
poorly in the face of inattentive respondents - a problem that is greatly pronounced when vast amounts of survey 
data nowadays is collected online. This project will develop and test diffferent strategies, grounded in previous 
research, to minimize the negative effects of respondent inattention. The study we propose will allow us to give 
concrete recommendations to applied researchers about best practices with regard to sensitive questions in surveys.  


Budget
Data collection, main sample (5000 respondents): 47400
Pilot study (500 respondents): 4 800
Total: 52 200


Budget motivation
All funding will go directly to the data collection for our study which will be conducted online to minimize costs. 
Based on previous studies we have conducted with Luc.id, we estimate the cost per respondent to be 1 USD. The majority 
of the expenses are payments to respondents for their participation in the study. The sample size calculations are 
based on careful power analyses to determine the appropriate sample size. The study involves a pilot study with 500 
respondents as well as the main study with 5000 respondents. 


Ethical committee
Lite osäker här, men tog "will be reviewed if it receives funds" - kanske är ljug?
